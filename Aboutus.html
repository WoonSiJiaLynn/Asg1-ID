                Lalisa Manoban was born on March 27, 1997, in Buriram, Thailand. She grew up loving dance and began training at a young age, often competing in local dance contests. Her natural talent made her stand out, and she eventually joined a dance crew that performed in major Thai events.
                Lisa auditioned for YG Entertainment in 2010 and became the only person accepted from Thailand, impressing the judges with her rhythm, charisma, and stage confidence. She moved to Korea alone at just 14 years old, learning a new language and starting years of intense training.
